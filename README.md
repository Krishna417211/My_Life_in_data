# 📊 My Life in Data

Have you ever wondered where your time really goes every day?

This project is a personal journey to track, analyze, and visualize how I spend my daily hours — from sleep and study to social time and chores. Using Python’s data science stack (Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib), I turned daily routine data into meaningful insights.

---

## 🧠 What I Did

- Tracked my daily activities in a CSV file over several days.
- Cleaned and explored the data using **Pandas**.
- Performed numerical and correlation analysis with **NumPy**.
- Visualized patterns using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**:
  - 📊 Bar charts
  - 🥧 Pie charts
  - 🔥 Heatmaps (for relationships between activities)

---

## 📈 Insights I Found

- How consistent (or not) my sleep and study hours are.
- What activities eat up more time than I expected.
- Interesting correlations — like when I study more, sleep often goes down 😅.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy 🔢
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨
- Google Colab (for writing and running the code)

## 📁 Files in This Repo

- `Your_Life_in_Data.ipynb` – Full Jupyter notebook with all analysis
- `your_life_data.csv` – My actual tracked data
- `heatmap.png` and other images – Visual summaries of the data

## 🌟 What's Next?

This was a fun and eye-opening starter project. I'd love to:
- Compare weekend vs weekday patterns
- Automate the tracking with a mobile app or Google Form
- Add weekly and monthly trends
